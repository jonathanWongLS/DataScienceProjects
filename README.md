# Projects
A repository for small projects I find fun made during my free time. There might not be many projects now as I am still pursuing my Software Engineering degree. Hope these projects inspire you to do projects too, no matter how big or small!

Everyone is allowed to access these projects in hopes that it helps you, your friends or anyone who is interested. Any suggestions to improve the code in any way is highly appreciated and highly encouraged. It will be a great way for me and whoever may be concerned to learn from the experienced. 

Don't have a good day, have a **great** day!
